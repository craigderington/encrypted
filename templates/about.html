                    <p>In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, 'cipher' is synonymous with 'code', as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.</p>

                    <p>AES, the acronym for the Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographer Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES was designed to be efficient in both hardware and software, and supports a block length of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.</p>

                    <p>PyCipher is a web service used to encrypt and decrypt text using the AES encryption algorithm.</p>

                    <p><b>Usage:</b></p>
                    <p>To encrypt a string of text, enter your input string in the text field and click the <i><b>Encrypt</b></i> button.<br />
                    The result of the encryption will appear in a base64 encoded string to prevent character encoding problems.</p>

                    <p>To decrypt an AES encrypted string, ensure the string is base64 encoded and was previously encrypted with AES algorithm!
                    Enter the encrypted text in the text field and click the <i><b>Decrypt</b></i> button.
                    </p>

                    <p>AES encryption is currently in use by many U.S. Government Agencies for securing <b><i>sensitive</i></b> material.  However, this level of encryption is not secure enough for <b><i>classified</i></b> documents.</p>
